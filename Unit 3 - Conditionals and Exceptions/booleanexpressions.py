#Booleam Expression
# Kinda like a mathematical formula 
# can only evaluate to true or false
# are my shoes tied = true 
# is 5 greater than 7 = flase
print(5 > 7)

# comparision operators!  == > < >= <=
# kinda like arithmetic operators + - / * ** % //
x = 5           #set x equal to 5, tell it what to be
print(x == 5)    # get x equals 5,ask a question
#the difference is that we are using one or two equal signs
#this is a perfect test question


print(4>=2) # true
print(1993==1993) # true
print(-90 < -99) # false
print(10 != 10) # false, "bash" "not"
